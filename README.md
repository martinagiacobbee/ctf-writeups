# 🧠 CTF Writeups – My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my write-ups and walkthroughs for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and platforms.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Document my learning in offensive and defensive security
- Show my hands-on skills in areas like reverse engineering, web exploitation, forensics, and binary exploitation
- Share knowledge with others starting their journey

## 🧭 Platforms Covered
- [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
- [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com/)
- Other events from [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/)

## 📂 Folder Structure
Each platform has its own folder, with challenges grouped by year or category when applicable.

## 🧪 Skills Demonstrated
- Linux enumeration and privilege escalation
- Web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, IDOR, etc.)
- Binary exploitation (buffer overflow, format strings)
- Reverse engineering (Ghidra, strings, ltrace, etc.)
- Cryptography and steganography
- Scripting (Python, Bash)
